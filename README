Visibility
==========

A very simple plugin that provides some visibility into what your Rails processes are doing
at any given time, by changing the process name seen by the operating system.

For example, without the visibility plugin, if you're running a local rails server you'll see this:

$ ps auxxx | grep "server"
USER       PID %CPU %MEM      VSZ    RSS   TT  STAT STARTED      TIME COMMAND
sd       10356   0.2  4.9   198748 102884 s006  R+   Sat05PM   7:36.12 ./script/server 

But when the visibility plugin is active, you'll see:

$ ps auxxx | grep "server"
USER       PID %CPU %MEM      VSZ    RSS   TT  STAT STARTED      TIME COMMAND
sd       10356   0.2  4.9   198748 102884 s006  R+   Sat05PM   7:36.12 ./script/server: GET /home/about

Obviously, on your local development server you probably already know which action is being executed,
but on a production server with multiple rails instances running, you would have to look at the logs
to figure out what is going on on each process. That's where something like this comes handy:

$ ps auxxx | grep "Rails"
 app      19258 10.6  8.0 164120 144128 ?       S    17:33  21:29 Rails: GET /foo/bar
 app      19262 11.9  8.5 174620 152264 ?       S    17:33  24:00 Rails: GET /foo/very_slow_action
 app      19267 11.1  8.1 162964 144876 ?       S    17:33  22:26 Rails                                     

You can customize the "prefix" on your environment.rb file by overriding the 'title_prefix' method.
For example, just add the following after the Rails::Initializer.run block:

def Visibility.title_prefix
  "Rails"
end



NOTE:
It seems that OS X caps process names at 30 characters or so, which limits the utility of this plugin.
Linux does allow for much longer names, so for those of you developing on macs and deploying on linux,
give it a try on your server before deciding whether to keep using it or not.

This idea for plugin came from the mongrel_proctitle plugin, created by Alexander Staubo <alex@purefiction.net>  
and available at http://purefiction.net/mongrel_proctitle/
